# Lab 7 - Exercise 2 - Investigate Your Microsoft 365 Data

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator, you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. As you proceed with your Microsoft 365 pilot project, you want to test how Adatum can investigate its Microsoft 365 data. You have decided to focus on performing a content search for deleted emails, which is a common request at Adatum, and then you want to analyze eDiscovery functionality by creating an eDiscovery case. You have asked Joni Sherman to conduct these tests on her client computer.

### Task 1 – Perform a content search for deleted emails

In this exercise, you will log into Microsoft 365 on LON-CL2 as Joni Sherman, and you will perform a content search that looks for emails with the keyword **IP address**.

1. Switch to LON-CL2, where you should still be logged in as the **Admin** account, and you should be logged into **Outlook on the web** as **Joni Sherman** from a prior lab. 

2. Joni needs to access the **Office 365 Security and Compliance** center. However, while she can access the Microsoft Office Home page, she does not have admin permissions; therefore, she cannot access the Microsoft 365 admin center from the Microsoft Office Home page, which means she cannot access the Security and Compliance center from the Microsoft 365 admin center. Therefore, she will have to access the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** directly. <br/>

    To do so, select a new tab in your Edge browser and enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://protection.office.com**.

3. In the **Office 365 Security and Compliance** center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Search**, and then under it select **Content search**.  <br/>

    ‎**Note**: If you cannot see **Search** in the navigation pane yet, you need to reload the browser tab with the **Security and Compliance Center.**

4. On the **Content search** window, in the **Searches** tab, select **(+) New search** on the top menu. This will initiate the **New search** wizard.

5. On the **Name your search** page, enter **Content Search Test** in the **Name** field and then select **Next**.

6. On the **Locations** page, verify the **Specific locations** option is selected; if not, then select it now. As you scroll down through the **Locations** window, note that there are 3 groups of locations. Each group has an On/Off toggle switch, and they are all set to Off. If you select all locations or set all 3 toggle switches to On, the query will run for an hour or more. <br/>

    Since you do not have time in this lab to search all three locations, select the toggle switch for the first group of locations to turn it **On**, but leave the other two groups turned **Off**, and then select **Next**.

7. On the **Condition card** page, enter **IP address** into the **Keywords** field and then select **Next**. Review the search content and then select **submit**. Then select **finish** and select **Done**.

8. On the **Searches** tab, the **Search query** process will automatically start. In the **Search query** pane on the left, scroll to the bottom, where the **Status** of the query is displayed. Wait for the status to show **Completed**. <br/>

    **Note:** It may take a couple of minutes for the query to run and the data to be displayed in the right-hand pane. When the content search finishes, you will see all mailbox items that were created for the sensitive information test of your custom DLP policy related to IP addresses. 

9. Close the **Content search** tab in your browser.

10. Leave the Security and Compliance Center tab open and continue with the next task.

You have successfully performed a content search for a specific key word across all locations of your tenant.
 

### Task 2 – Create an eDiscovery case

In this task, you will create an eDiscovery case, add an In-Place Hold to the case to preserve mailbox content, and create a search to discover data from the hold. You will continue using Joni Sherman’s user account. Having been assigned the eDiscovery Managers role back in Lab 1, Joni has the permissions necessary to create an eDiscovery case.

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL2 as the **Admin** account and signed into Microsoft 365 as Joni Sherman. 

2. The **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** should still be open in a tab in Microsoft Edge. If so, select that tab now. If not, then enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://protection.office.com.** 

3. In the **Security and Compliance Center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **eDiscovery**, and then under it, select **Core**.

4. On the **Core eDiscovery** window, select the **(+) Create a case** button that appears above the list of cases.

5. In the **New case** window, enter **IP Address Violation** in the **Case name** field and select **Save**.

6. On the **Core eDiscovery** page, select the **Open** button that appears to the left of the **IP Address Violation** case.

7. On the **IP Address Violation** window, select the **Holds** tab on the menu bar.

8. Select **(+) Create** to create a new hold. This initiates the **Create a new hold** wizard.

9. On the **Name your hold** page, enter **IP Address Violation - Content** into the **Name** field and then select **Next**.

10. On the **Choose locations** page, check whether the Exchange mail location is enbaled if not slide the Toggle to **on**, select the **Choose users, groups, or teams** link.

11. On the **Edit locations** page, select the **Choose users, groups, or teams** button.

12. On the **Exchange email** page, enter **Lynne** into the search field and then select the **Search** icon to the right of the field. 

13. Scroll down on the page to see the search results. Under **Users, groups, or teams**, select the check box next to **Lynne Robbins**, and then select the **Choose** button at the bottom of the page.

14. On the **Edit locations** window, verify that one user, group, or team was added, which was Lynne Robbins. Select **Done**.

15. On the **Choose locations** page, **1 user, group, or team** is displayed to the right of **Exchange email**. Select **Next**.

16. On the **Query conditions** page, enter **IP address** into the **Keywords** box and then select **Next**.

17. On the **Review your settings** page, review the values and select **Edit** next to any that need to be modified. When you are satisfied with the settings, select the **submit** and then select **done**.

18. On the **IP address violation - Content** window, select **Close**.

19. This returns you to the **Holds** tab on the **IP Address violation &gt; Core ED** page. Select the **Searches** tab from the top menu.

20. On the **Searches** tab, select the **+New search** button. 

21. In the **New search** window, enter **IP Address Violation - search** in the **Name** field and select **Next**.

22. Under **Locations**, select the **Locations on hold** option.

23. Select **Next**.

24. In the **Save search** window, in the search query pane on the left , enter **IP Address** in the **Keyword** field and then select **Next**. Review the search content and then select **Submit**.Then select **Done**.

25. This will initiate a search query that looks for the keywords **IP Address**. In the detail pane on the left, scroll to the bottom, where the **Status** of the query is displayed. Wait for the status to show **Completed**. <br/>

    **Note:** It may take a couple of minutes for the query to run and the data to be displayed in the right-hand pane. Once the query is finished, wait for the preview results to be displayed. 

26. Close the **eDiscovery** tab in your browser.

27. Leave LON-CL2 open as well as all other browser tabs and continue with the next task.


You have now created an eDiscovery case, added an In-Place Hold to preserve mailbox content, and created a search to discover data from the hold.
